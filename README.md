# PixEvent (Pub/Sub) ‚Äì Lightweight Event System for Unity

PixEvent is a powerful and flexible **event management system** built for Unity projects. It allows developers to subscribe to events with priority, conditional logic, one-time execution, and synchronous/asynchronous delivery. Its simple structure makes it easy to integrate, extend, and test.

## 1. Event System Introduction

PixEvent enables communication via any class that implements the `IEvent` interface. This supports a loosely-coupled communication model across systems.

---

## 2. Subscription Mechanisms

### Standard Subscription

```csharp
PixEvent.Subscribe<MyEvent>(OnMyEvent, priority: 10, async: false);
```

Allows setting callback priority and asynchronous execution.

#### Asynchronous Subscription Example

For heavy or long-running tasks, use `async: true` to run the callback on a separate thread:

```csharp
PixEvent.Subscribe<MyEvent>(evt => { 
    Debug.Log("Heavy async process started...");
    Task.Delay(1000).Wait();
    Debug.Log("Heavy async process done.");
}, async: true);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: In this example, `Task.Delay().Wait()` is used for demonstration. In Unity environments, using true `async/await` can require additional handling or libraries like UniTask.

---

### One-Time Subscription

```csharp
PixEvent.OneTimeSubscribe<MyEvent>(OnMyEvent);
```

Callback is triggered only once and then unsubscribed automatically.

---

### Conditional Subscription

```csharp
PixEvent.ConditionalSubscribe<MyEvent>(
    condition: e => e.Value > 5,
    callback: OnMyEvent
);
```

Callback is triggered only when the event data satisfies the given condition.

---

## 3. Publishing Events

```csharp
PixEvent.Publish(new MyEvent { Value = 10 }, delayMs: 200);
```

Events can be published with an optional delay. Subscribers are called in descending order of priority.

---

## 4. Unsubscribing

### Remove a Specific Callback

```csharp
PixEvent.Unsubscribe<MyEvent>(OnMyEvent);
```

### Remove All Subscribers

```csharp
PixEvent.UnsubscribeAll<MyEvent>();
```

---

## 5. Using Empty Events

For simple event calls that don't require parameters, use the `EmptyEvent` class:

```csharp
PixEvent.Subscribe(() => Debug.Log("Triggered"));
PixEvent.Publish();
```

---

## 6. Logging Support

Enable logging for internal operations:

```csharp
PixEvent.LogEvents = true;
```

---

## 7. Helpful Utility Methods

### Check for Subscribers

```csharp
if (PixEvent.HasSubscribers<MyEvent>())
{
    // At least one subscriber exists
}
```

---

## üìå Notes

- Higher `priority` means the callback runs earlier.
- Callbacks marked with `async = true` are executed on separate threads.
- Exceptions are automatically logged via Unity‚Äôs `Debug.LogError`.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Example Usage

```csharp
public class MyEvent : IEvent
{
    public string Message;
}

// Subscribe
PixEvent.Subscribe<MyEvent>(e => Debug.Log(e.Message));

// Publish
PixEvent.Publish(new MyEvent { Message = "Hello World" });
```

This system helps you build more modular, readable, and maintainable code structures.
